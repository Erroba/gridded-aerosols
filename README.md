# gridded-aerosols
script for getting and analyzing gridded aerosol products

GEOS-5 data from: https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/GMAO_products/NRT_products.php

Instructions for running scripts to download GEOS-5 2D aerosol data, partition it into seperate forecast files and finally put it in a format (temporary ungrib files) ready to be used in metgrid.exe: 

1. Compilation of the fortran code needs to be done first

$ ifort -convert big_endian -I/usr/include write_aerosols_for_metgrid.f -L/st1/luong/lib/netcdf-4.3.3.1/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdff -o write_aerosols_for_metgrid.Linux
{likely will need to change pathways to netcdf library}

2. Run python script to download and process GEOS5 2D aerosol data 

Library Requirements are: os, subprocess, glob, sys, numpy, netCDF4, pandas, requests, get_aeronet

Now the script can be run: $python create_geos5_aod_aux_input.py

This should create GEOS5.FILE:* type ungrib files


After the GEOS5.FILE:* type ungrib files have been made, namelist.wps needs to be told to read them at the metgrid.exe stage. In namelist.wps add something like this;

&metgrid
 fg_name = 'FILE','GEOS5.FILE'


Then, the instructions from David Ovens are applicable from 4.1 onwards on this page https://atmos.washington.edu/~ovens/running_wrf_with_geos5_aerosols/README

Attached is a the namelist.input file being used for real.exe/wrf.exe. The key lines are:

 auxinput15_inname                   = 'wrfaerinput_d<domain>',
 auxinput15_outname                  = 'auxinput15_d<domain>_<date>',
 auxinput15_interval                 = 180,
 io_form_auxinput15                  = 2,   
 force_use_old_data                  = .true.
